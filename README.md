- 👋 Hi, I’m @DeGaRoR
- 👀 I’m interested in plenty of things, mostly webgames development, and everything 3D...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning plenty everyday :-D. I have become a power hobbyist with HTML/JS/CSS. For the 3D side of tings, I work with Blender, and everything free (GIMP, Krita, Meshroom, MakeHuman, InkScape, FotoSketcher, etc.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on stuff, why not? Being just an amateur, I use this as my personal repo only. If anyone takes interest in what I do, make sure to drop me a note!
- 📫 How to reach me: send me a little mail - replace the "-" with the first 4 letters of my nickname --nis.--uder@gmail.com / we get enough spam like this, don't we?
